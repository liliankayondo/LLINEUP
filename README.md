# The LLIN Evaluation Uganda Project (LLINEUP) was a cluster radomised project 
that aimed to determine the impact of PBO-pyethroid LLINS versus the pyrethroid only LLINs on malarai incidence in children below 10
##We use genetics to analyse Anopheles samples collected from the study to
1. Study impact of intervention on the vector densities
2. If the interventions had an effect on genetic diversity indicies
3. LLIN specific selection during the trial

##Contained here are the notebooks and scripts we used to do the analysis explained in paper @ https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.06.17.659961 ##
